# Capstone #2 Project Proposal

## Arpita Pandya

### Goal for user

My goal for this capstone project is that, I want to create a **_Social media full stack web application** which allows users to connect with different users. As i am using differnt social media application, I am really inspired about the different functionalities, and that made me to build this website to learn in depth. My target user is that someone who likes to interact with people worldwide and who loves to appreciate different user's post by giving them feedback(likes, comment)

### User Flow

User is required to have their own account and log in to view the post as well to meet people. User can update their profile(image, password, about section). User can hit like on different user's post and give them feedback in a comment section. If user wanna leave using the app they can delete their account. Profile section will also show who they are following and being followed, including(joining date).

### Goals

This is my second capstone where i define my work based on expectations. I believe this website will bring a joy to the user. If i will have a more time i would like to develop this web application by adding more functionalities where users can give certain expressions based on their mood and feelings(buttons: celebration, happy, sad, insightful) on the post.
